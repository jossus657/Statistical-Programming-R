```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Floating Point Rep

```{r}
x <- 0.3/3
0.1 == x

y <- 5 - 3 - 0.1 
y == 1.9
```

- because every decimal representation in R is an approximation

Binary

(-1)^(0,1)(b1*2^0 + b2*2^1 + b3*2^2 +...+ bn*2^n) where bi is either 0 or 1 

n bits yield 2^n unique positive numbers

binary digits always read right to left (unless decimal)
- think about them as placeholders

(0010)2 == (2)10 --> 0010 in binary is equal to 2 in decimal

110.01 = 2^2 + 2^1 + 0 + 0 + 2^-2 = 6.25


find binary of 11

11/2 -> 5 R1
5/2 -> 2 R1
2/2 -> 1 R0
1

Read bottom up to get 1011

find binary of 0.25

0.25*2 -> 0.5 -> 0
0.5*2 -> 1.0 -> 1
0.0*2 -> 0.0 -> 0

we get .010
