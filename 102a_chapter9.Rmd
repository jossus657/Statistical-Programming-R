# Randomization Tests

Hypothesis Tests

x ~ N(mx, sx)     -> x1,...,xn -> x_bar
y ~ N(my, sy)     -> y1,...,yn -> y_bar

H0:  mx = my
H1:  mx > my

or

H0: mx - my = 0
H1: mx - my > 0

x_bar - y_bar

p-value: p = p(observation as extreme or more extreme than one observed | H0 true)


Assume

x_bar - y_bar ~ N(mx - my, SD(x_bar - y_bar))

a = sig level

p > a => fail to reject null

p < a -> reject null

# CLT

if n > 30 can assume that x and y bar follow a normal distribution
and we can still use this standard procedure


Example

Population -> SRS -> 5 subjects -> Randomly Assign -> training (x)
                                                   -> control (y)
                                                   
training (mx): 54, 66 -> mx = 60
control (my): 57, 72, 30 -> my = 53

H0: mx - my = 0
H1: mx - my > 0
